A constant-time implementation of BLISS-I

Companion code to the submission "GALACTICS: Gaussian Sampling for
Lattice-Based Constant-Time Implementation of Cryptographic Signatures,
Revisited".

This implementation is written for the SUPERCOP testing framework.
To test it, download supercop from:

   https://bench.cr.yp.to/supercop/supercop-20190110.tar.xz

and untar the archive. Then set okcompilers/c appropriately, and compile
the required libraries using

   ./do-part used

Finally, place this directory (bliss1_galactics) into the crypto_sign
subdirectory, and run:

   ./do-part crypto_sign bliss1_galactics

to launch the measurement process. See also:

for details.
