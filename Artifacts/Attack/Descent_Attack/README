This artifact demonstrates the descent attack.

 - Requirements:
    - python3    (>=3.7.3)
    - sage       (>= 8.5)
    - Tensorflow (>=1.13.0)

- How to:
    (1) Genere the desired number of samples with sage genere.py
        [NB_OF_SAMPLES].

    (2) Launch the attack with python3 postTreatment.py
        [NAME_OF_THE_FILE_PRODUCED_BY (1)] [THRESHOLD_FOR_LOCALIZATION]

- Test case (with optimized parameters)
    sage genere.py 300000 && python3 postTreatment.py spc_guess_4_300000
    0.4


# NOTES
- You can change the version of BLISS to attack by modifying the
Flag BLISS in the header of the file BLISS.sage.

- Hyperparameters  of the descent can be tailored by changing the values
the lists B, EPS, MAXMOU in the file postTreatment.py.

- The number of steps in the descent can be adapted by modifying the
variable LIM. ( please set LIM_NORM around LIM/2)
